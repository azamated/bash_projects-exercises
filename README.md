Bash Script:

size-validator.sh:
	-- takes a file path as an argument and outputs "OK" if the file size is less than or equal to 1024 bytes, and "FAIL" if the file size is greater than 1024 bytes.


unzipWithGrep.sh:
	-- takes two parameters as input - the file name (the first parameter) and the search pattern (the second parameter), after which it unzips the file and searches for a search pattern in it.
